Tips for Maximizing Value with Sonnet 3.7:

Be very specific in the context section - more detail leads to better outputs

Ask for alternative approaches or scenarios

Request risk assessments for critical decisions

Use the system to validate assumptions and identify potential blind spots

For complex strategies, consider breaking down the execution planning into multiple sessions:

First session: High-level roadmap

Second session: Detailed workstream planning

Third session: Risk assessment and mitigation

Fourth session: Resource allocation and timeline optimization

Remember to:

Update the context section as circumstances change

Request periodic reviews of the execution plan

Use the system to troubleshoot when facing obstacles

Ask for best practices and lessons learned from similar implementations

This template can be adjusted based on your specific needs and the complexity of your strategy. The key is to provide enough context while maintaining clear structure in the requested outputs.
