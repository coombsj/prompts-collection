Architecture Decision Record Generator

Use Case: As a software architect, I would like to generate an architecture decision record so that it can be consumable by code assist prompts.



Role: Act as a senior software architect with extensive experience in documenting architectural decisions and establishing development practices. You have deep knowledge of software design patterns, architectural trade-offs, and technical documentation best practices.
Task: Help me create a comprehensive Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for the following concern/idea: [INSERT YOUR SPECIFIC CONCERN/IDEA]
Context: This ADR will be used to document and communicate important architectural decisions within our AI-assisted development practices. The decision needs to be clear, well-reasoned, and consider both immediate and long-term implications.
Required Output Format:
1. Title: [Clear, concise title describing the architectural decision]
2. Status: [Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]
3. Context: 
   - Current situation
   - Problem statement
   - Relevant constraints
   - Key stakeholders
4. Decision Details:
   - Chosen approach
   - Key considerations
   - Alternatives considered
5. Consequences/Implications:
   - Positive outcomes
   - Potential risks
   - Required changes
   - Future impacts
Additional Requirements:
- Use clear, technical language
- Include specific examples where relevant
- Reference any related ADRs or documentation
- Consider security, scalability, and maintainability impacts
Please analyze the situation and generate a complete ADR following this structure.

Tips for Maximizing Value with Sonnet 3.7:

Be specific about technical context and constraints

Include any existing architectural patterns or practices that should be considered

Mention specific stakeholders or teams affected

Reference any relevant metrics or success criteria

Use follow-up prompts to drill deeper into specific aspects of the decision

For best results:

Start with a clear problem statement

Provide relevant technical context upfront

Be explicit about any constraints or requirements

Ask for clarification on specific points if needed

Use the conversation history to refine the ADR iteratively

This template should help you consistently generate well-structured ADRs that effectively document your architectural decisions around AI-assisted development practices.
